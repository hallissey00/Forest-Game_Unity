## Assignment Brief

This is a 3rd person controller, 3D challenge game, based on a scenario in which the goal is to build an object from tools and components found in the immediate vicinity.

Level1/2
begins with the player standing inside a well-lit forest. The goal is for the user to collect
the appropriate tools and components to build an object before the timer runs out. The object
under construction may be a campfire, tent, dam, house, or something similar that fits your
scenario.

o There are work areas, tools, components etc. positioned around the forest between the
various vegetation.

o Some of the tools are rotating and/or glowing or highlighted in order to attract the user’s
attention. This should be achieved through the Unity animation tool.

o The player should control the 3rd person controller with the arrow keys.

o Include a prompt for the user to pick up the rotating/glowing tools.
The player should pick up the tool by colliding with the tool object. On collision,
the tool object should disappear, a (collection) sound is played, and an inventory
of tools is updated in the Heads Up Display (HUD).
The user should collect at least 3 different tools.
When all tools are collected, the user is then prompted to collect components for
the object which, like the tools, are placed around the forest and are
rotating/glowing. Components can be planks of wood, canvas for a tent, wood
for a fire, poles or similar.
Again the user is kept informed of his/her progress through the HUD. There is
an opportunity here to gain marks by developing an informative image based
display that lets the user know how many tools are left to collect and a separate
counter to inform the user how many components are left to collect.

o When the user has collected all of the tools and components, then the object under
construction appears in the forest.
Use sound effects and animation with some visual effects when the object
appears.
When the user touches the object, he/she is taken to Level 2 (include a prompt
so that the user knows to touch the object).

o A countdown timer is clearly visible on the HUD. When the timer reaches zero, the
‘Game Over’ scene is loaded. The timeframe must allow for the game to be achievable
yet challenging.
Level 2 has slightly more difficult game play than Level 1. Students may copy their Level 1 scene and 
name it Level 2. 

## Constraints on game play
o The user should not be allowed to collect components until they have collected all of the tools for 
that level.
o The object under construction should not appear until all items are collected in the correct order.
o The level can only be completed by touching the constructed object or by the timer running out.
o For the sake of testing, the main menu should include a link to all scenes
